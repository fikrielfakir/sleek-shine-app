Design a modern, bold, and appetizing digital ecosystem for a French fast-food brand specialized in tacos, burgers, salads, and desserts. The solution should include:

🎯 Public Landing Page & Ordering App (Customer Side)

Dark-themed UI with strong contrast: black background, oversized white bold typography, and vibrant food images with accents of red, yellow, orange, and neon tones.

Hero Section: fullscreen video or macro shot of tacos (melting cheese, sizzling meat, crispy fries, fresh sauces) with overlay text: “Savourez nos tacos français – en ligne, à emporter ou en livraison”.

Menu & Ordering Flow:

Grid-based food gallery showcasing tacos as the hero, then burgers, salads, and desserts.

Interactive menu cards with images, descriptions, prices, and Add to Cart buttons.

Quick order process with cart summary, checkout, and multiple payment methods.

Delivery or pickup options.

User Experience: smooth animations (steam rising, cheese pulls, sauce drips) making food look irresistible (La nourriture a l’air délicieuse).

Customer engagement: CTAs like Commander Maintenant with glowing hover effects.

📊 Restaurant Dashboard (For Staff & Management)

Interface for restaurant team to:

View incoming orders in real-time (dine-in, take-away, delivery).

Update order status (pending, preparing, ready, delivered).

Manage menu items (add/remove tacos, change prices, upload photos).

Monitor daily/weekly sales and inventory.

Design style: clean, card-based layout with tables and charts, easy-to-read typography, and food category icons.

🛠️ Admin Dashboard (For Full Control)

Admin Interface to:

Manage restaurants/branches.

Add/edit staff accounts, assign roles & permissions.

Oversee customer accounts & order history.

Generate analytics reports (revenue, best-selling items, customer trends).

Control marketing banners, promotions, and app-wide notifications.

Design style: modern, minimal, intuitive – sidebar navigation, graphs, KPIs, and quick-action buttons.

⚙️ UX Approach

Customer app = fun, delicious, immersive → designed to stimulate appetite and make ordering fast & enjoyable.

Restaurant dashboard = efficient, simple, real-time → optimized for speed and clarity.

Admin dashboard = strategic, powerful, organized → focus on full control, data visualization, and scalability.

Mood: bold, tasty, vibrant, and irresistible for customers — professional, clear, and structured for management.
